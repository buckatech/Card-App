          GoofSpiel is a simple betting based card game
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player is given a deck of cards containing one suit valued from ace to king
        </li>
        <li>
          A single suited deck is used as the 'prize' deck, which the players bet a card from thier deck,
          hoping to out bet their opponent and recieve the points associated with the value of the 'prize' card
          up for grabs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all cards from the 'prize' deck have been won, the points are counted and the player with the highest score
          is the winner!!
